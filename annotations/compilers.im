// This file was added shortly before the Gnu C and C++ release 5 of the
// compilers became available. A new version of the compilers can simply be
// tested by specifying the new compilers' version at CVERSION
// 

// To check the software using the 5-version of the bobcat library that
// library can be made available in a separate directory (e.g.,

// ISN // /usr/lib/bobcat-5) and an /etc/ld.so.conf.d/bobcat-5.conf file can be
// ISN // prepared specifying /usr/lib/bobcat-5. That directory should then have the
// ISN // libbobcat-5.so* library and links, and after `ldconfig -v' the linker will
// ISN // detect the proper library.
