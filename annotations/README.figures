The primary figures are stored in zip/svg.zip. These are vector graphic
figures that can be manipulated or created by the `inkscape' program.

When creating or modifying figures:
===================================
    cd zip
    ./prepare

    this will extract the zips in their appropriate directories.
    
Then 
====
        cd svg
    
    chdir to the appropriate directory and start inkscape
    with the name of the figure to create/edit
    
    When a figure is created or modified, save its .svg format. A new picture
    can be given a certain size. 

>>> USE PICTURE SIZES OF 190 (w) X 280 (h) MM,
    just a bit smaller than A4:

    -> shift-ctrl d     to define the size
    -> within the inkscape window: 5 to zoom in or use the zoom icon (3rd
                                                    magnifying glass icon)

Save the image using ctrl-S, and then 
=====================================
    (save .eps and .pdf formats in the svg directory)

    Save As 

    When saving select export object size, not the page size
   
    Save in the format Encapsulated Postscript (eps) and PDF

    (There's no need to convert the pdf to gif: that happens at ./install
    below) 


Having performed all image-editing, cd back to ~/zip and run:
=============================================================
    ./install

    This also installs the files at the ../latex and ../html directories

Finally:
========
    ./collect

    to update the zips.


To include an image use:

    figure(file)(caption)(label)

E.g.,
    figure(ptrmembers/figfilename)
        (Person_dbase objects: Persons reached via Person *pp)
        (PersonFig)
