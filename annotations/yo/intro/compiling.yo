To compile a bf(C++) program, a bf(C++) i(compiler) is required. Considering
the free nature of this document, it won't come as a surprise that a
 emi(free compiler) is suggested here. The
 i(Free Software Foundation) (i(FSF)) provides at hi(http://www.gnu.org)
 tlurl(http://www.gnu.org) a free bf(C++)
compiler which is, among other places, also part of the i(Debian)
 hi(http://www.debian.org)
 (tlurl(http://www.debian.org)) distribution of i(Linux)
 (hi(http://www.linux.org) tlurl(http://www.linux.org)).

Always use the latest bf(C++) standard supported by your compiler. When the
latest standard isn't used by default, but is already partially implemented it
can usually be selected by specifying the appropriate flag. E.g., to use the
C++2a standard specify the flag ti(--std=c++2a). In the annotations() it is
assumed that this flag is used when compiling the examples.
